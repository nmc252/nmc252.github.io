## 🔧 What I Do
- 🛠️ Design and troubleshoot **IP/MPLS networks** using **Nokia SR OS**
- 📡 Optimize routing protocols like **IS-IS**, **OSPF**, and **BGP**
- 🔐 Implement secure, resilient network architectures for large-scale environments

---

## 🚀 What I'm Learning
I'm currently diving deep into **network automation**, with a focus on:
- 🧰 **Git** for version control and collaboration
- 🤖 **Ansible** for automating network configurations and deployments
- 📚 Building reproducible, scalable workflows for modern **NetOps**

---

## 🧠 My Goals
- Automate repetitive network tasks to reduce human error and increase efficiency
- Contribute to open-source network automation projects
- Bridge the gap between traditional networking and DevOps practices
